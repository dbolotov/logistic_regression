Logistic regression (classification) algorithm template implemented in MATLAB and python.

Suited for problems with continuous features and a 2-class dependent variable.

Regression parameters are learned by minimizing a cost function with fminunc (MATLAB/Octave) and optimize.fmin (python).
Splits input .csv file into training and test sets.

Computes the following performance metrics:
	Test and training set prediction accuracy
	Confusion matrix, specificity, sensitivity
	Misclassification error

Uses class_function_01.txt as an example dataset.

Code based on ml-class.org, Ex.2.

Files:
logistic_regression_script.m: development script.

logistic_regression.m: above script, in function form. Allows specification of learning parameters.

confMatrix.m, costFunction.m, misclassError.m, sigmoid.m: MATLAB functions used by main script and function.

log_reg.py: python implementation of regression script.
